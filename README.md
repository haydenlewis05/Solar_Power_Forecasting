1.3 Solar Power Forecasting
This dataset describes the power output and meteorological measurements as time-
series data from rooftop photovoltaic cells. This data can be used to make predic-
tions of future power output from such installations.

1.3.1 Dataset
https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.m37pvmd99
This dataset comprises measured photovoltaic (PV) power generation data and on-
site weather data collected from 60 grid-connected rooftop PV stations in Hong
Kong over a three-year period (2021-2023) [4].

1.3.2 Problem
Your task is to develop a machine learning solution that can predict the power
output of a photovoltaic installation over time. Note that you can choose to :
  • produce a model which can predict the output of a particular installation,
  based on the past data from that installation
  • produce a model which generalises to all installations, which will predict
  future output based on metadata about that installation. (You may wish to
  complete the above task before proceeding to this one).
